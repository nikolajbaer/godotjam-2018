Godot Game Jam Entry - 2018
===========================

Theme: Temperature

Work In Progress!

Story / Overview: You are a fearless balloon pilot. After having recovered the precious silver horn from the mutant mockingbirds, you must escape their piercing attacks by harnessing the wind variations at altitudes [1].

And you must deflect the mockingbird's swoops with your trusty flamethrower! Also beware floating spike mines laid by the mutant mockingbird's evil master, Snorbert! Too many pecks by the birds, or collisions with the mines will tear at your balloon, eventually causing it to burst.

Your trusted friend Horace has laid out a path for you to follow. Learn the winds and fly your balloon through the path to lead to safety!

Bon Voyage!
